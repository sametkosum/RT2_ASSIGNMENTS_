RT1 - Assignment 2 - ROS Simulator
**Professor: Carmine Tommaso Recchiuto, Student: Ahmet Samet Kosum (s5635830)**

For our second assignment in Research Track 1, we were instructed to include the necessary documentation in our github repository. I opted to utilize Sphinx.

# RT2 - Assignment 2 - Jupyter
Commencing from the second task in Research Track 1, we were requested to develop a jupyter notebook as a replacement for the user interface (the node «A»), and explore the utilization of widgets to convey the following information to the user::
- The robot's current position and the status of all assigned and canceled targets in the environment.
- the distance of the nearest obstacle

# RT2 - Assignment 3 - Statistics 
In the third task of Research Track 2, we were tasked with conducting a statistical analysis on the initial task of Research Track 1. This analysis involved comparing two distinct implementations: one provided by a colleague and my own solution. The objective was to determine which implementation performs better when silver and golden tokens are randomly distributed throughout the environment.
